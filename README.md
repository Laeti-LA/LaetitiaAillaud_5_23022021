This is the 5th Project of the Junior Web Developer path. 
The project aims to : 
1. Interact with a web service with JavaScript 
2. Manage JavaScript events 
3. Validate data from external sources 
4. Create a test plan for an application 

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
